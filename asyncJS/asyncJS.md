***The JavaScript engine***  (in a hosting environment (browser)) is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack.
The browser provides web APIs like the DOM, AJAX, and Timers.

***Call Stack*** is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place in a script *(ex. bookmark)*
that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function.

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). **LIFO**

JS is **Single Threaded**, but browser itself with Web APIs getting take cares for making requests. Once it's done it's pushed back obto the stack as call back.

***A callback*** is a function passed as an argument to another function. (possible to have to many of them)
