<span style="color: blue;">The JavaScript engine</span>  (in a hosting environment (browser)) is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack.
The browser provides web APIs like the DOM, AJAX, and Timers.

<span style="color: blue;">Call Stack</span> is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place in a script *(ex. bookmark)*
that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function.

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). **LIFO**
